# Azure AD B2C to Microsoft Entra External ID Migration Summary

## Current Implementation Analysis ‚úÖ

**Authentication Architecture:**
- **Server**: ASP.NET Core with Microsoft.Identity.Web (JWT Bearer)
- **Client**: Blazor WebAssembly with Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal
- **Tenant**: `nrcmycosis.b2clogin.com` with custom user flows
- **Custom Features**: Role-based authorization using B2C extension attributes

**Key Dependencies:**
- Microsoft.Identity.Web 3.6.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è (has security vulnerability)
- Microsoft.Graph 4.11.0 (for user role management)
- Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal 8.0.12

## Migration Requirements Analysis ‚úÖ

### **High-Level Changes Required:**

1. **Configuration Updates** (Medium Complexity)
   - Update authentication endpoints from `b2clogin.com` to `ciamlogin.com`
   - Reconfigure user flows and policies
   - Update Graph API scopes and permissions

2. **Custom Role System Migration** (High Complexity)
   - Migrate B2C extension attributes to Entra External ID custom attributes
   - Update UserService.cs Graph API queries
   - Validate role-based authorization continues working

3. **Azure Portal Configuration** (High Complexity)
   - Create new Entra External ID tenant
   - Register applications (server + client)
   - Configure user flows and custom attributes
   - Migrate user accounts and role data

### **Technical Compatibility:**
‚úÖ **Microsoft.Identity.Web** - Compatible with configuration changes  
‚úÖ **Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal** - Compatible with endpoint updates  
‚úÖ **Microsoft.Graph** - Compatible with potential scope updates  
‚úÖ **Role Management System** - Compatible with attribute schema migration  

## Risk Assessment üîç

### **Critical Risks:**
1. **Service Downtime** - Authentication will break during migration
2. **Data Loss** - User accounts and roles must be carefully migrated
3. **Custom Attribute Schema** - Role storage mechanism may need updates
4. **Timeline Pressure** - Only 14 months until B2C P2 retirement (March 15, 2026)

### **Medium Risks:**
1. **API Changes** - Microsoft Graph queries may need updates
2. **User Experience** - Different authentication flows may confuse users
3. **Testing Complexity** - Need separate environments for validation

### **Low Risks:**
1. **Library Compatibility** - Core authentication libraries are compatible
2. **Code Changes** - Mostly configuration updates required

## Migration Plan Overview üìã

**Timeline: 8-10 weeks (Recommended completion: Q4 2025)**

### **Phase 1: Preparation (3 weeks)**
- Create Entra External ID development tenant
- Configure applications and user flows
- Set up custom attributes for role storage

### **Phase 2: Code Migration (2 weeks)**
- Update server and client configurations
- Migrate UserService Graph API integration
- Security package updates

### **Phase 3: Testing (2 weeks)**
- Unit, integration, and security testing
- End-to-end authentication validation
- Performance and load testing

### **Phase 4: Staging Migration (1 week)**
- Deploy to staging environment
- User acceptance testing
- Final validation

### **Phase 5: Production Migration (1 week)**
- User data migration
- Production deployment
- Go-live monitoring

### **Phase 6: Post-Migration (1 week)**
- 24/7 monitoring and support
- Documentation updates
- B2C tenant decommission planning

## Immediate Actions Required üö®

### **Security Priority:**
- [ ] **Upgrade Microsoft.Identity.Web** from 3.6.0 to latest version (addresses known vulnerability)

### **Planning Priority:**
- [ ] **Create Entra External ID development tenant** for testing
- [ ] **Assign project team** with Azure portal access
- [ ] **Schedule stakeholder review** of migration plan

### **Documentation Created:**
- [üìÑ Detailed Migration Analysis](./Azure-AD-B2C-to-Entra-External-ID-Migration-Analysis.md)
- [üìã Step-by-Step Migration Plan](./Migration-Plan-Azure-AD-B2C-to-Entra-External-ID.md)

## Recommended Next Steps üéØ

1. **Immediate (Next 30 days):**
   - Review and approve migration plan
   - Start security package updates
   - Begin Entra External ID development tenant setup

2. **Short-term (Next 90 days):**
   - Complete development environment migration
   - Perform comprehensive testing
   - Prepare production migration procedures

3. **Medium-term (Next 6 months):**
   - Execute production migration
   - Monitor system stability
   - Complete B2C decommission planning

## Cost Considerations üí∞

- **Entra External ID**: Free tier up to 50,000 monthly active users
- **Migration Effort**: ~8-10 weeks development time
- **Risk of Delay**: Increasing complexity closer to retirement deadline

---

**Conclusion:** The migration is technically feasible with manageable risk. The current implementation uses standard Microsoft Identity libraries, which facilitates the transition. Key success factors are early planning, thorough testing, and careful data migration procedures.

**Critical Success Factor:** Must begin migration preparation immediately to ensure completion well before the March 15, 2026 deadline.
